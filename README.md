# PGL App

**PGL App** is a project developed as part of the Multimedia Programming and Mobile Devices module. Throughout the course, this application will be expanded and improved through practices organized in repository branches. Each branch corresponds to a specific practice and focuses on implementing a particular functionality or aspect of the application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized to facilitate learning and modular development. Each practice will have its own workspace and will be documented independently in Markdown files within the docs directory.
